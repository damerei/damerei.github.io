title: Truth and Beauty
subtitle: A lovely book by a great physicist

A book with an outsized influence on me was Truth and Beauty, by the Nobel Prize winning physicist Subramanyan Chandrasekhar. 
In particular I loved the comparison of one of Ramanujan's theta identities to the "austere beauty 
of “Day,” “Night,” “Evening,” and “Dawn” which Michelangelo has set over the tombs of Giuliano de' Medici."
